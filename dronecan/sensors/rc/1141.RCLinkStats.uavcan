#
# This definition describes metadata and statistics for a RF control link.
# It provides information regarding a link's signal quality, as well as transmitter
# power, and antenna information. It accomodates single-radio, and dual-radio
# link architectures. It provides information for both uplink (control unit to airborne
# receiver), and downlink (airborne receiver to control unit) data.

uint8 STATUS_RSSI_VALID = 1 # RSSI field is valid

# Uplink - received signal strength, in decibel-milliwatts (RSSI dBm) for antennas 1 and 2 respectively. 
# Ranges from # -255 to 0. (An integer value of 100 means RSSI is -100dBm)
uint8 uplink_rssi_1
uint8 uplink_rssi_2

# Link quality, on a scale from 1 to 255. Is a proxy for packet loss. 0 means data is unavailable. 1 and 255 are mapped to 0% and 100% of packets received.
uint8 uplink_link_quality

# Signal-to-noise ratio.
int8 uplink_snr

# This is an implementation-specific enum. May represent the OTA protocol used,
# and transmission rate.
uint8 rf_mode

# This is an implementation-specific enum describing the current transmitter nominal
# power level.
uint8 uplink_tx_power

# Statistics for downlink data, ie telemetry. See their respective `uplink` fields for
# descriptions.
uint8 downlink_rssi_1
uint8 downlink_rssi_2
uint8 downlink_link_quality
int8 downlink_snr

# Active antenna on transmitter and receiver. Example: 1 for antenna 1, and 2 for antenna 2. 
# Not applicable for single-antenna links.
